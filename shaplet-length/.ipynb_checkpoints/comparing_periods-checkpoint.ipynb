If the window size is n and our shaplet size is s, n cannot be less than s otherwise we would never catch any consecutive pair of peaks.  Realistically, we would like catch multiple peaks at a time and average their distances together but at a minimum to be gaurenteed to catch a single period, n needs to be at least 2s.  Since we do not know the length of the shaplet before hand, we will experiment by testing a number of window sizes to determine correct size."
